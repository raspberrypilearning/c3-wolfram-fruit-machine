The first step is to find pictures of fruits and get them into your notebook so you can use them in your project.

Copy and Paste, or drag and drop these images into your notebook, and put them into a list.

![Strawberry](images/strawberry.png)
![Watermelon](images/watermelon.png)
![Cherries](images/cherries.png)
![Lemon](images/lemon.png)
![Grapes](images/grapes.png)

Lists start with `{` and end with `}`, and each item is separated by a `,`.
Assign this list to the variable name `fruits`.
