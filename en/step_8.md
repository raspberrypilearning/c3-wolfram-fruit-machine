## Challenge: end the game

Can you make the game end when the player loses all their points (meaning, when `score` becomes 0 or smaller)? To do this, you need to put and extra condition into the `Which` statement.

You need to check the score to see if the player has run out of points. If the player has run out, tell them that they've lost the game. Then reset the game.

Running out of points is one possible outcome of a random choice. Include this outcome as a condition in the `Which` statement.

If the score is 0 or less than 0, then:
1. Set the score to 100
1. Print a `Text` message to tell the user that they have run out of points
